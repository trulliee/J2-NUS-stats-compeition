This repository contains the project report submitted to the 2020 NUS Statistics and Applied Probability Competition by Trulli Lee and team, representing Catholic Junior College.

## 📌 Project Title
**How is food wastage related to the level of affluence of countries?**

## 📄 Summary
This study investigates the correlation between income levels and food wastage across demographic groups in Singapore, using:
- Google Form survey responses (n = 134)
- Public data from NEA, Statista, and WWF
- Chi-square test of independence to test the hypothesis

Findings suggest strong evidence (p < 0.01) that **higher income groups are more likely to waste food**.

## 🧪 Statistical Method Used
- Chi-square test for independence
- Significance level: 1%
- Raw data collected via survey
- Sample validated via Central Limit Theorem assumptions
